# Enclave configuration file.
#
# How much memory to allocate for enclaves (in MiB).
# memory_mib: 307200
# memory_mib: 278528
memory_mib: 262144
#
# How many CPUs to reserve for enclaves.
# cpu_count: 40
cpu_count: 32
#
# Alternatively, the exact CPUs to be reserved for the enclave can be explicitly
# configured by using `cpu_pool` (like below), instead of `cpu_count`.
# Note: cpu_count and cpu_pool conflict with each other. Only use exactly one of them.
# Example of reserving CPUs 2, 3, and 6 through 9:
# cpu_pool: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47
# cpu_pool: 8-15,32-47
# cpu_pool: 8-47
